## üîë Managing your secrets

There are two ways this repository uses secrets.

### üë§ VS Code User Secrets

Install the dotnet user-secrets tool by running the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-user-secrets
```

Then set your bot's token:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set discordToken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### üêã Docker environment variables

When running the bot in Docker, you need to pass your secrets as environment variables:

- Create a `.env` file at the repo's root directory.
  - There's a `.envsample` file there you can copy from.
- Add your bot's Discord token to the `.env` file under the key `discordToken`:

```env
discordToken=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the bot

To run Lily locally, open the repo in VS Code, and execute the following commands in a new terminal:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
cd src/Lily
dotnet run
```

### üêã Running the bot in Docker

To run Lily in Docker:

- Open the repo in VS Code.
- Ensure your Discord token is established in a `.env` file as described above.
- Execute the following command in a new terminal:

```bash
docker compose up
```

That's it, Lily is officially running in Docker!

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

We don't really know where this is going yet. However, we do know a few items we'd like to see realized in the future:

- [ ] Add support for integrating with Open AI.
